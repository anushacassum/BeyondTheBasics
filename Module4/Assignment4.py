# ASSIGNMENT FOR LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
# ## Rewrite the following functions as lambda functions ##
def functionA(x,y):
    return x * y

def functionB(x,y):
    if x%2:
        return x**y
    else:
        return y**x

def functionC(str_x):
    print(f'I was able to print {str_x}!')


### Take the input as input_list.
# Write lambda functions that would produce:
# Part [i]: A list of squares of the cubes of each of the items
# Part [ii]: A dictionary of key value pairs, indicating whether an item is even or not.
# Part [iii]: A tuple of only the odd numbers in the input list.
# Part [iv]: The sum of all numbers less than equal to 5.
input_list = [5, 7, 9, 3, 8, 2]


# Part [i]:
# Your code

# Part [ii]:
# Your code

# Part [iii]:
# Your code

# Part [iv]:
# Your code
